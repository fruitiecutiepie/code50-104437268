# Spotify Search Bar
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Spotify Search Bar is a program that mimics a search bar by using Spotify's API to perform data manipulation of songs, artists, and album details. It is written fully in Python.

The program starts by checking the user's internet connection. Without functioning internet, the program will not be able to request Spotify Web API. Then, the program asks input of songs, artists, or albums from the user. 

## Confession
This project is not perfect. It does not cover every bug and it can be more optimised. Future improvements will have to be made. For example, there are too much iteration involving the process of extracting user inputs and displaying results. These problems should be solved by turning those processes into functions.
